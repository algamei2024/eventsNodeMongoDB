# Event Management Project

I am working on developing an Event Management project, which is a web application aimed at applying my skills in Node.js and MongoDB. The project focuses on building an attractive user interface and a robust 

backend for efficiently managing events.

# Project Goals:

Applying Node.js Techniques: I use Node.js as the backend to build a fast and scalable server, helping to process requests efficiently.

Utilizing MongoDB: I leverage MongoDB as a NoSQL database to store event and user data flexibly and easily.

Learning User Interface Design: Using libraries like Bootstrap and EJS, I am designing an interactive interface that enhances the user experience.

## Libraries Used:

**axios**: For making HTTP requests to communicate with the API.

**bcrypt-nodejs**: For hashing passwords and securing user data.

**body-parser**: For parsing incoming request data.

**bootstrap**: For creating a visually appealing and user-friendly interface.

**connect-flash**: For managing temporary messages, such as success or error notifications.

**ejs**: As a templating engine to facilitate the creation of dynamic web pages.

**express**: The core framework for developing web applications.

**express-session**: For managing user sessions.

**express-validator**: For validating user input data.

**jquery**: For simplifying interactions with page elements.

**moment**: For easy and effective date and time management.

**mongoose**: For interacting with the MongoDB database.

**multer**: For handling file uploads.

**passport and passport-local**: For providing a secure login system for users.

## Features:

Create, edit, and delete events.

Register participants and manage their data.

A simple and user-friendly interface.

A comprehensive security system to protect user data.

I consider this project a great opportunity to apply what I've learned and enhance my programming skills, preparing me for future projects.
